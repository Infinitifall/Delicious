Renting a domain and running your own server is easy and inexpensive. Here is what I did to set up a tiny vps hosting this website, multiple small bots, a minimal IRC server and frontend. This is a self reference guide for future me but might help or inspire somebody trying to get a similar setup working for under ~ 4$/month.


### The VPS

- Rent a ~ 3$/month vps from [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)

- Create a new user to [ssh](https://man.archlinux.org/man/ssh.1) into instead of root

  ```bash
  useradd -m -G wheel archie
  passwd archie

  # now you can
  ssh archie@<your-vps-ip-address>
  ```

- Set up [ufw](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Uncomplicated_Firewall), an uncomplicated firewall as the name suggests

  ```bash
  # install
  sudo pacman -S ufw
  sudo ufw enable

  # allow some nice ports
  sudo ufw default deny
  sudo ufw allow 22    # ssh
  sudo ufw allow 80    # http
  sudo ufw allow 443   # https
  sudo ufw allow 6667  # irc
  sudo ufw allow 6697  # secure irc
  ```

- Set up [nginx](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/nginx), a performant and easy to use HTTP server

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S nginx
  sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
  # edit the config file for https
  # and set root directories
  ```

- Install [tmux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/tmux) to run small scripts and bots (poor man's daemon),

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S tmux
  # tmux
  # tmux ls
  # tmux attach -t <number>
  ```

- Install [miniirc](https://github.com/jrosdahl/miniircd) as opposed to a full blown [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) server such as [unrealircd](https://www.unrealircd.org/)

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jrosdahl/miniircd.git
  cd miniircd
  ./miniircd --help
  # run miniircd in a tmux window
  ```

- Set up [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/) as a self hosted frontend to the IRC server

  ```bash
  yay -S thelounge
  sudo systemctl enable --now thelounge
  # edit the config to set up a reverse proxy with nginx
  # and lock down settings to default config

  # add users if using private mode, this lets thelounge manage
  # them and store scrollback etc
  sudo -u thelounge thelounge add user <username>
  ```


### Domain registration and HTTPS

- Register a domain for ~ 12$/year using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) and set the DNS records to point to the vps you just set up. Use multiple subdomains like `irc.`, `login.`, `mydemo.` that can be directed to different servers in the future.

- After you have bought a domain and pointed the records to the vps, get certs using [certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot)

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S certbot certbot-nginx
  sudo certbot
  # adjust permissions for cert files
  # certbot should automatically edit the nginx config
  # but you might still need to tweak it
  ```


### On local computer

- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and clone this website, which comes with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for LaTex support, and some [HTML boilerplate](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/) so embeds work across social media websites

  ```bash
  # install
  sudo pacman -S rubygems
  sudo gem install jekyll bundler
  # add ruby gems path to your PATH environment variable

  # clone this website and install dependencies
  git clone https://github.com/Infinitifall/infinitifall.net
  cd infinitifall.net
  bundle install

  # build
  bundle exec jekyll build
  # or serve locally
  # bundle exec jekyll build
  ```

- Finally, copy over the built website to the vps using [sftp](https://man.archlinux.org/man/sftp.1)

  ```bash
  # ssh into vps and make a directory for your website, a one time thing
  ssh archie@<your-vps-ip-address>
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/nginx/html/<your-domain-name>
  exit

  # navigate to the mysite directory and create an archive of your built site
  tar -zcf ../mysite.tar.gz _site/

  # stfp into vps and copy over archive
  sftp root@<your-vps-ip-address>
  put ../mysite.tar.gz /usr/share/nginx/html/<your-domain-name>/
  exit

  # ssh into vps and extract archive
  ssh archie@<your-vps-ip-address>
  cd /usr/share/nginx/html/<your-domain-name>/
  sudo tar -xzf mysite.tar.gz -C ./ --strip-components=1
  exit
  ```
